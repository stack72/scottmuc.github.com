<div class="entry-content"><p>Every now and then I like to sit in a coffee shop on a Sunday and focus on writing some code. This weekend I had the pleasure of spending this geeky time with a colleague, <a href="http://literateprogrammer.blogspot.in/">Chris Ford</a>(<a href="https://twitter.com/ctford">twitter</a>).</p>

<p>Chris has gotten me interested into an open source toolkit for creating sounds and making music called <a href="https://github.com/overtone/overtone">Overtone</a>. Here&rsquo;s a talk about demonstrates functional composition using clojure through music and overtone.</p>

<iframe width="640" height="510" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/Mfsnlbd-4xQ " frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>


<p>That talk made me want to play with overtone. Here&rsquo;s the diary of my workstation setup.</p>

<h2>Leiningen</h2>

<p><img class="right" src="http://leiningen.org/img/leiningen.jpg"> Thinking I know what I&rsquo;m doing I say &ldquo;So, Overtone is in Clojure, right? So I&rsquo;ll first install that.&rdquo;. To which he replied &ldquo;No, you need to install <a href="http://leiningen.org/">Leiningen</a>.&rdquo;. What?! I want to install clojure, why do I need this oddly named tool? Already my world has been turned upside down.</p>

<p>Leiningen is a package manager for Clojure. I can&rsquo;t say I understand completely what it&rsquo;s doing, but when I did a <code>sudo port install leiningen</code> I saw Maven was being installed. Chris calmed me down and said that <code>lein</code> hides the pain so I don&rsquo;t have to worry about it.</p>

<p>Sure enough, the install works. I run <code>lein new mucmusic</code> and a simple project structure is setup for me. I updated the <code>project.clj</code> to refer to the 1.4.0 version of Clojure.</p>

<p>I then run <code>lein repl</code> and see the package manager at work. It downloads Clojure for me and I&rsquo;m in a repl. I try the most basic thing I know <code>(+ 1 1)</code> and it works! I can only imagine what&rsquo;s going on behind the scenes. I find it interesting that a package management tool is responsible for obtaining the language you&rsquo;re going to develop in. It makes a whole lot of sense actually. It&rsquo;s sort of like <a href="http://www.virtualenv.org/en/latest/">virtualenv</a>, but not quite.</p>

<h2>Clojure</h2>

<p><img class="left" src="http://clojure.org/space/showimage/clojure-icon.gif"> Since I&rsquo;m still coming to grips on writing code in Clojure I can&rsquo;t comment on the language, but what I really like so far is how accessible the documentation is. Simply evaluating <code>(doc +)</code> will print the documentation for &lsquo;+&rsquo; function  and <code>(source +)</code> prints out the source code. The REPL made it very easy to get started.</p>

<p>One thing that tripped me up was using a namespace I had defined. I learned the the &lsquo; character is used to indicate the following text is a symbol and not to be evaluated. Also, the first project I created had an underscore in it. In order to use that namespace I had to use a hyphen when using it.</p>

<h2>Overtone</h2>

<p><img class="right" src="http://overtone.github.com/media/logo.png"> Happy that I can write and evaluate Clojure code it was time to setup Overtone. This part was really nice. All I did was update the <code>project.clj</code> file and added the overtone dependency. The next time I ran <code>lein repl</code> it downloaded overtone and set everything up for me.</p>

<p>In the repl I loaded overtone via <code>(use 'overtone.live)</code> and here&rsquo;s the output:</p>

<pre><code>reply.eval-modes.nrepl=&gt; (use 'overtone.live)
--&gt; Loading Overtone...
--&gt; Booting internal SuperCollider server...
--&gt; Connecting to internal SuperCollider server...

    Collaborative Programmable Music. v0.8

Hello ThoughtWorks, just take a moment to pause and focus your creative powers...
</code></pre>

<p>Woah! Booting internal SuperCollider server? Is Clojure so powerful that I can run my own atom smasher?
Turns out the answer is unknown on that, but what <code>overtone.live</code> does is smartly start up
<a href="http://supercollider.sourceforge.net/">SuperCollider</a> which is &ldquo;an environment and programming language
for real time audio synthesis and algorithmic composition&rdquo;. Ahh! So overtone needs this to actually
create audio.</p>

<p>I continue to follow the <a href="https://github.com/overtone/overtone">README</a> and make my first sound.</p>

<pre><code>(demo (sin-osc))
</code></pre>

<p>This code rewards me with the beautiful sound that is a sine wave. Curious as to what <code>demo</code> and <code>sin-osc</code>
do I load up the docs in the repl.</p>

<pre><code>overtone.live/demo
([&amp; body])
Macro
  Listen to an anonymous synth definition for a fixed period of time.
  Useful for experimentation.  If the root node is not an out ugen, then
  it will add one automatically.  You can specify a timeout in seconds
  as the first argument otherwise it defaults to *demo-time* ms. See
  #'run for a version of demo that does not add an out ugen.

  (demo (sin-osc 440))      ;=&gt; plays a sine wave for *demo-time* ms
  (demo 0.5 (sin-osc 440))  ;=&gt; plays a sine wave for half a second
nil
user=&gt; (doc sin-osc)
-------------------------
overtone.live/sin-osc
([freq phase])

  Sine table lookup oscillator 

  [freq 440.0, phase 0.0]

  freq  - Frequency in Hertz 
  phase - Phase offset or modulator in radians 

  Outputs a sine wave with values oscillating between -1 and 1 similar to 
  osc except that the table has already been fixed as a sine table of 8192 
  entries.

  Sine waves are often used for creating sub-basses or are mixed with 
  other waveforms to add extra body or bottom end to a sound. They contain 
  no harmonics and consist entirely of the fundamental frequency. This 
  means that they're not suitable for subtractive synthesis i.e. 
  passing through filters such as a hpf or lpf. However, they are useful 
  for additive synthesis i.e. adding multiple sine waves together at 
  different frequencies, amplitudes and phase to create new timbres.

  Default rate: :ar
</code></pre>

<p>No wonder people love programming in clojure! This idea of the documentation living in the
code is wonderful. I&rsquo;m generally used to googling for a function name, but this makes that step
unnecessary.</p>

<h2>VimClojure</h2>

<p>Chris, like myself, also uses <a href="http://www.vim.org/">Vim</a>. So first thing I wanted to do is get some syntax highlighting. Chris points me to <a href="https://github.com/daveray/vimclojure-easy">vimclojure-easy</a>, but I didn&rsquo;t want to replace my vim configuration. I already maintain my vim in a tidy and versioned way. Looking at the this repo gave me the direction I needed to set this up. I cloned <a href="https://github.com/vim-scripts/VimClojure">VimClojure</a> into my <code>~/.vim/bundle</code> directory (and removed its .git directory). I launch vim on a clojure file and I have syntax highlighting!</p>

<h2>lein-tarsier and nailgun</h2>

<p>Thinking I was complete I tried some of the vim shortcuts to evaluate some clojure from within vim. Then I realized I&rsquo;m
not quite done (feels like my visit to the <a href="http://indianfrro.gov.in/frro/">FRRO</a>. This is now where the JVM comes in.
Clojure is a JIT compiled language. In order to compile, it needs a JVM. Starting up a JVM all the time is a very
slow and painful process.</p>

<p>Lein-tarsier (tarsier is the type of creature on the <a href="http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780596529833.do">O&#8217;Reilly Vim book</a>
is a lein plugin that starts up a VimClojure server. To install this, I just added it to my lein profile. It didn&rsquo;t work
at first, but that was because MacPorts installs version 1.6 of lein. Nailgun was some C code that you have to download a compile and make reference to it in your vimrc. I&rsquo;m sort of lost on how all these components work together.</p>

<p>A quick <code>lein upgrade</code> got me to version 2.0. Then an execution of <code>lein vimclojure</code> and the server is up and running.</p>

<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>After installing a bunch of oddly named things I was able to play the pieces from Chris&#8217; talk in vim.</p>

<p>There were some details that I left out (and forgot). I don&rsquo;t think I would have gotten this far without help from Chris
and the considerable documentation that&rsquo;s in the README files and wikis. Part of me also thinks that it shouldn&rsquo;t
require this much work. As a side project, I&rsquo;m going to look into pulling all of these steps into a Vagrant
configuration management setup. I think it would be nice to go <code>vagrant up overtone</code> and have a working overtone
development environment.</p>
