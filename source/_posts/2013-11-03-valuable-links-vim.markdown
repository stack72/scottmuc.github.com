## First Off - Introducing Valuable Links

Today I've decided to start something new. I tend to send my friends and colleagues
links about all sorts of things. Usually when they are pertinent to a problem they are
having, or to supplement a conversation I've had with them. My usual process to reproduce
these links ends up being a search in: [Twitter][twitter], [Pocket][pocket], History, and my Bookmarks.

Also, when I share my links I tend to write a few sentences about them. It adds a personal
touch and a bit of context, so that's why I'm exploring this channel for displaying them.
As opposed to using a bookmarking website.

## Valuable Links for Vim

I would say I'm a moderate [Vim](http://www.vim.org/) user. I have a simple `.vimrc` with few plugins. Learning
to be compotent at `vim` has made my computing experience so much better. Here are a few
websites that have helped me out:

* [Vim Primer][vim-primer] - I can't think of a more thorough primer. Even after knowing
  vim for a while I learned a lot from this article. Not only that, it helped reinforce
  the things I knew already to better explain them.
* [Vim After 11 Years][vim-after-11-years] - A good story on someone's journey learning
  vim for the last 11 years.
* [Vim Golf][vimgolf] - Try and do the editing exercises in the minimum number of keystrokes.
* [Destroy All Software][destroyallsoftware] - Watching [Gary Bernhardt][gbh] is a great
  way to learn vim. His excellent screencasts have 3 episodes focused on Vim:
  [File Navigation in Vim][das-ep13], [Some Vim Tips][das-ep30], and
  [The vimrc][das-ep60].

### My Own Tips

* Disable the arrow keys. They just encourage bad habits. For me, I had to use the
  `h`, `j`, `l`, and `l` out of necessity. I travel a lot, and writing code on an
  airplane is difficult if you have to move your hand to the arrow keys. The key is
  not to do this too early otherwise you'll be frustrated like [Yehuda Katz][yehuda].
* Don't use a premade vim configuration. Things like [Janus][janus] make it easy
  for vim to behave more like [TextMate][textmate] or [Sublime][sublime] (both great
  editors), but if that's what you want, why not just use them? Instead, strive to
  keep your `.vimrc` your own and rely on plugins to get the benefits of the excellent
  work that's been done by other people. [Clif Reeder][leaving-janus] articulates when
  to leave Janus quite well.
* Keep it simple! The more you stray from default, the more dependant you are on
  your own configuration. Use plugins in order to extend functionality. If you can't
  explain every line of your own `.vimrc` then either figure it out, or remove it.
* As you grow more comfortable, start using vim everywhere. If you use **gmail**, turn
  on the keyboard shortcuts (some of them are vim like). If you're using Chrome,
  install [Vimium](http://vimium.github.io/). It allows you to navigate the browser
  as if it's vim. There's even
  [VsVim](http://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/59ca71b3-a4a3-46ca-8fe1-0e90e3f79329)
  for Visual Studio users!

Admittedly, I still have a lot to learn. I'm by no means an expert.

**Disclaimer** - I'm a "learn it the hard way" type of person. So that may explain
my thoughts on the subject.

Hope you enjoyed the first of what could be many "valuable links" posts.
