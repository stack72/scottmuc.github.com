Developers like to talk about being in a state of
[flow](http://psygrammer.com/2011/02/10/the-flow-programming-in-ecstasy/). This is when time just seems to fly
by and you're writing more code in a few hours than you do in several days when you're not "flowing". While I think
flowing can be postive, it often can do more harm than good if going on for too long.

In the past I would complain that the environment around me kept me from the **flow**. I would look forward to the quiet
times in the office where I could zone out for hours and complete some wild and crazy code I was working on. Many times
I would return the next day and realize that I could have done it simpler, or there were many other aspects of the
problem that I didn't take into consideration. One of the biggest complaints about flow is that it takes a long time to
get into that state. How can we minimize this time, and keep these flows shorter?

{% img right /images/blog/flow.png %}What I found myself needing were breaks. Brief moments to reflect on the past bit of effort and reflect on what work was
done and where it's heading. Many times this has resulted in an "aha" moment and see that my path is not going towards a
solution that is best for the project. It's also a good time to check your assumptions. You may be flowing towards a
dead-end because of something a little bit of planning could have prevented.

When programming solo I try my best to always practice the [pomodoro technique](http://www.pomodorotechnique.com/).
There have been so many times that the break (and I try to be disciplined about stopping when the timer goes off, even
when I'm in the middle of something) introduces new ways of tackling the problem.

When pairing I experience similar gains with breaks. I never considered this technique when pairing, because I always thought that the
practice already mitigated the risks I mentioned earlier. That may be true, but thanks to [Paul
Daigle](http://johnpdaigle.com/), I found that it was just as effective when pairing. It's even better because you have
someone to reflect upon the pairing session with. A quick time away from the code is a good time to recall what problem
you're actually trying to solve and whether or not the direction you're going is actually going to lead you there.

If you're leading a technical team and you see everyone glued to their monitors and typing franctically, you might think
that they are "flowing" and working at a heightened level of productivity. Think again, they could possibly be racing towards
the wrong direction. A team that's moving around, going for walks, taking 5 to do a
[tabata](http://www.tabatatimer.com/) to me is a sign of a more switched on team.
