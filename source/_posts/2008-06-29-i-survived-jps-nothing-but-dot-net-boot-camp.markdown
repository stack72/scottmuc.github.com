After a big of pleading I got the privilege of being able to attend [Jean-Paul Boodhoo's Nothing But Dot Net Bootcamp](http://www.jpboodhoo.com/blog/NothinButNetVancouverBCJune23rd27thTheEmpireLandmarkHotel.aspx)!

JP is quite well known in the .Net circuit for his passion for development and his pragmatic approach to software design. Typical posts about his course underline that you'll be [giving up your home life](http://kyle.baley.org/2007/07/nothin-but-net-or-how-to-justify-ignoring-your-home-life/) for a week. Since I'm a bachelor, it wasn't a big deal for me, but I did feel a bit bad for the guys that had wives and kids at home. Our typical day was no shorter than 14 hours, and one lasted 20 hours. This was for a grand total of 80 hours of training in a 5 day span! The crazy part was that the material was flying at you so fast you didn't even get a chance to be tired.

What I wasn't prepared for was how inspirational JP can be. Not just as a developer but as a person. Not only did he feed us enough developer fundamentals, he also provided management tips, and inspirational stories and references. He shed a new light on what it means to be a developer. I greatly appreciated these tangents, and it has made me think a bit more about what I am trying to accomplish in this world.

The other great takeaway from the course was the great people that attended it. There was a total of 15 of us from all backgrounds and skill levels. Not only were there great programmers, there were some great personalities too. I'll be making sure I keep in touch with all the local developers, and plan on a 6 month re-union with them in the future. I have to give a shout out to *Ted*, and *Peter* from [AndOrNot](http://andornot.com/) for keeping things entertaining.

This is getting long enough, and I know that trying to write everything that I experienced in the course is next to impossible. I'll probably be referencing skills I learned in the course for quite a while.

If you stumbled upon this post because you are thinking of attending his course, I highly recommend that you do! Even if I had to front my own money for the course I would. It's the best investment you can do for your career.
