A few months ago I posted a simple tutorial on how to use [Pester (a powershell bdd testing framework)](http://scottmuc.com/blog/development/pester-bdd-for-the-system-administrator/). I'm starting to practice the making of screencasts so I thought I would add some audio/visual to the blog post. I start rambling in the last 5 minutes so I won't feel insulted if you stop paying attention after that part.

Also, I want to thank [Manoj Mahalingam](https://github.com/manojlds) and [Martin Aatmaa](http://blog.martin.aatmaa.net/) for their feedback and contributions!
