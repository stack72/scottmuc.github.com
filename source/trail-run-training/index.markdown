For some odd reason, I've decided to enter a 13km trail run. I need something to get
myself back into shape, and I like running, so this seems like a good start.

Nothing makes training for a goal more interesting than making it all more transparent
and visible. So here's a calendar leading up to my first race and a journal of what exercises
I've done to train:
