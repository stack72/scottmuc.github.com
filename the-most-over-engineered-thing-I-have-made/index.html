<div class="entry-content"><p>The other day I overheard some interns boasting about their complicated shell setup. They felt pretty good about
using tmux, zsh, and aliasing the heck out of everything. One of them had to re-map copy and paste because they messed
that up, but they felt awesome when they figured out a clever work around.</p>

<p>We&rsquo;ve all been there at some point. It&rsquo;s something that you grow out of over time. At least I hope so. Here&rsquo;s a story of
the most complicated thing I&rsquo;ve made and I&rsquo;ll start with a network diagram of my basement suite circa 2003:</p>

<p><a href="/images/blog/complicated-network.png" title="Network Diagram"><img class="center" src="/images/blog/complicated-network.png" width="600"></a></p>

<h2>My Contribution to Over-Engineering</h2>

<p>Hmm, after looking at that network diagram again, I&rsquo;m now thinking about how complicated I&rsquo;ve made a lot of things!
Anyways, the most complicated thing I&rsquo;ve made was a music playing setup for my home. Doesn&rsquo;t sound like it should
be complicated, right?</p>

<p>Here are some of the requirements:</p>

<ul>
<li>Rebooting my laptop doesn&rsquo;t stop the music. I was quad booting (that&rsquo;s another story) and would switch frequently</li>
<li>Control can be from any computer (I did some NAT translation so I could control it from outside the house too)</li>
<li>The machine playing the music had to be quiet (PCs those days were much louder)</li>
</ul>


<h3>Architecture</h3>

<blockquote><p>The result was an mp3 playing system that required 5 computers in order to work.</p></blockquote>

<p><a href="/images/blog/complicated-rack.jpg" title="Server Rack"><img class="right" src="/images/blog/complicated-rack.jpg" width="300"></a> First there was the <strong>file server</strong> that contained
all my music. It would expose files to the network via Nfs and Samba. I was pretty meticulous when it came to
organizing my files. Every artist had a directory, and every album was a sub-directory. In case you&rsquo;re wondering,
I organized artist names as <em>Last Name, First Name</em>. All the mp3s were created by ripping my personal CD collection.</p>

<p>Second was the <strong>music player</strong> box. This was an underclocked machine with no hard drive. This way I was able to run it
without any fans except for the power supply. It used PXE boot load the operating system and would Nfs mount it&rsquo;s filesystem.
The only thing running on it was <a href="http://www.musicpd.org/" title="Music Player Daemon Website">music player daemon</a> which played mp3s that were also Nfs mounted.</p>

<p>So since I required PXE boot, I setup a <strong>network config</strong> server. It was my local DNS, DHCP, and TFTP host. I
configured DHCP to respond to the MAC address of the music player box and provide it a TFTP location to fetch its kernel.
I had a DNS zone setup that handled internal .muc-central.com records (eg: jukebox.muc-central.com).</p>

<p>Those 3 servers were sufficient to have a working music playing system, but it didn&rsquo;t have a user interface. This
required the addition the <strong>web server</strong> which ran Apache and PHP to host <a href="http://mpd.wikia.com/wiki/Client:PhpMp" title="PHP Music Player">PhpMp</a> that connected to the music
player boxes <code>mpd</code> service.</p>

<p>Now with a UI, you can start playing songs, and update a playlist from any machine in the house. The 5th machine is the
<strong>client</strong>, which was my laptop at the time. This was before the era of smart phones, but I imagine with some tweaks, a
mobile web browser would have worked just fine too.</p>

<h2>The Result</h2>

<p><a href="/images/blog/complicated-livingroom.jpg" title="Living Room"><img class="left" src="/images/blog/complicated-livingroom.jpg" width="515"></a>
<a href="/images/blog/complicated-ui.jpg" title="Screenshot"><img class="left" src="/images/blog/complicated-ui.jpg" width="515"></a></p>

<p><span style="color: #eaeaea;">hack to break the floats</span></p>

<p>The machine that plays music is in a closet near the entrance into my apartment. Then I setup some shelves to
put my <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Altec-Lansing-ACS48-Computer-Speakers/product-reviews/B00000JBJF" title="ACS48 Reviews">Altec Langsing ACS48</a> speakers on top of. The volume on the speakers was set to max so the volume could be
controlled through the software.</p>

<p>The web interface wasn&rsquo;t fancy but I still prefer it to many of the applications I&rsquo;ve used recently. It&rsquo;s a basic PHP
app called <a href="http://mpd.wikia.com/wiki/Client:PhpMp" title="PHP Music Player">PhpMp</a>. What I liked about it the most was the playlist was easy to modify. My friends would browse
the music collection and click a link to add a song to the playlist. The only picture I can find is an old desktop
screenshot where you can see the playlist in the bottom left of the screen.</p>

<h2>Lesson Learned</h2>

<p>Although I would never set something up like that again, I&rsquo;m glad I did it. It was an excellent learning experience and
it actually was one of the best digital music setups I had. It also was the gateway to me starting to write technical
<a href="http://muc-central.com/articles/index.php?file=FreeBSD%20Jukebox" title="My First Online Article">articles</a> online 10 years ago! While listening to the interns, it came to me that this is simply a right
of passage. I don&rsquo;t think I would be where I am today if I did the simplest thing to solve all my problems. One thing it
did make me think about is that I probably should contrive complex solutions as a way to practice my understanding
of of complex systems.</p>

<p>Things I learned by doing this:</p>

<ul>
<li>PXE booting</li>
<li>Diskless computing</li>
<li>TFTP</li>
<li>Non trivial DHCP</li>
</ul>
