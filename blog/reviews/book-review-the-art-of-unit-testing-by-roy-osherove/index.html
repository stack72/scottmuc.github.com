In a recent splurge I purchased 4 books from <a href="http://www.manning.com/">Manning Press</a> with one of them being <a href="http://www.manning.com/osherove/">The Art of Unit Testing</a> by <strong>Roy Osherove</strong>.</p>

<p>I would categorize myself as relatively new to unit testing. My first hands on testing was when I took the Nothing but .Net bootcamp with JP Boodhoo but he emphasized BDD style tests. I saw the benefit of BDD but didn&rsquo;t feel I had the know how to implement them properly. About 3 months ago I started writing tests in a more unit test like fashion and things started clicking.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>This book felt like an Assertion of what I&rsquo;ve learned over the last year. As I read the book I kept finding stories I could relate to. In my attempts to apply unit testing to my own code, I experienced nearly everything Roy talks about in this book.</p>

<p><strong>Chapter 5</strong> was great a explaining the differences between the terms <a href="http://www.martinfowler.com/articles/mocksArentStubs.html">Stub and Mock</a>. What I liked was how he provided samples of manual stubs and mocks to give the reader a peak under the curtain as to what a mock (err faking, Roy&rsquo;s personal word preference) framework does for us. I can understand how the work mock is overloaded now, and can appreciate the proper terminology and it helps when explaining these concepts to others.</p>

<p>For me <strong>Chapters 6 and 7</strong> are where I got the most out of the book. Through all my reading of testing on-line, I found it quite simple because the scope of the demos were so small. I felt these two chapters armed me with some good principals on organizing tests and treating them just as important as my production code.</p>

<p>All in all this was one of the easiest programming books I&rsquo;ve ever read. Roy&rsquo;s tone was fun (especially his little jab at <a href="http://ayende.com/">Ayende</a>), but wasn&rsquo;t so opinionate that it sounded preachy. In fact I felt comfortable making my own opinions that extend his foundations. Roy presented the material in a way that seems like he assumes you&rsquo;re not an idiot. There wasn&rsquo;t a lot of &ldquo;hand holding&rdquo; which can be found in other entry level books. He provides ample resources for those that want more instruction on certain topics which creates a good pace for the reader.</p>

<p>As for the negatives: I wish it was a little longer. I don&rsquo;t know why, but I felt that there was more to say on a lot of topics. Perhaps more examples, which could seem a bit repatitive, but could be skipped by those who got the message. I also didn&rsquo;t like how <a href="http://typemock.com/">TypeMock</a> was being pushed heavily and the disclaimer that Roy worked for TypeMock didn&rsquo;t come in until near the end.</p>

<p>I would reccomend this book to anyone who is new to unit testing. I think I read the book at almost a perfect time. I knew enough that I could see past the trivial example to the message he&rsquo;s delivering, but not enough to skip all the material because it was so obvious. A seasoned unit tester might not get as much value from this book, but I would urge them to get it anyways so they can loan it to those they work with who are new to testing.</p>

<p>A great prelude to reading this book is to watch Roy review the test suites for the following projects:</p>

<p><a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/rosherove/archive/2009/03/20/test-review-1-nerddinner.aspx">Nerd Dinner</a> <br />
<a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/rosherove/archive/2009/03/21/test-review-2-asp-net-mvc-unit-tests.aspx">Asp.Net MVC</a> <br />
<a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/rosherove/archive/2009/03/23/test-review-3-unity.aspx">Microsoft Unity</a></p>

<p>Be warned, you&rsquo;ll be watching a grumpy Roy at 2am :&ndash;). Roy also has a <a href="http://osherove.com/blog">great blog</a> and is active on <a href="http://twitter.com/RoyOsherove">twitter</a> as well.</p>
