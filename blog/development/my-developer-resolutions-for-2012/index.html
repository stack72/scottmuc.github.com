<div class="entry-content"><p>An interesting thing about 2011 is that my resolutions from earlier became quite prominent. Given that 8 months of 2011 were spent on a large account with less technical focus, I&rsquo;m amazed at some of the technical things that I&rsquo;ve done.</p>

<h2>Reflections on 2011 and carry over from 2010:</h2>

<ul>
<li>Mouseless Computing (2010) &ndash; I think the practice is paying off as a colleague of mine told me &ldquo;You make Windows fly!&rdquo;, and he&rsquo;s a savvy keyboard only Mac OSX user.</li>
<li>OSS participation (2010) &ndash; I started the following projects:

<ul>
<li>Pester &ndash; I&rsquo;ve blogged about it and it&rsquo;s getting some traction out there in the wild. It&rsquo;s a spec based testing framework for Powershell. The first implementation was written on a hung-over new years day!</li>
<li>yari &ndash; A Windows ruby version manager. Currently being used by a very large client. I wrote this on a whim, because I thought I could do better than what was previously implemented. Turned out the client liked this a lot more and decided to adopt it right away.</li>
<li>YDeliver &ndash; The beginnings of a Continuous Delivery framework for .Net projects.</li>
<li>Misc &ndash; Submitted a patch to OpenMRS, a bug report to Puppet, directory additions to PSGet</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Learn VIM (2011) &ndash; This went really well. I&rsquo;m definitely no expert at this point but I&rsquo;m continuoully trying to learn new things. I&rsquo;ve setup a github project for my vimfiles which is a fun way to share my tweaks.</li>
<li>Develop an Android App (2011) &ndash; Nope, didn&rsquo;t do anything here. It&rsquo;s actually dropped off my radar as it&rsquo;s not really something I&rsquo;m interested in anymore</li>
<li>Learn a server provisioning automation tool (2011) &ndash; I barely get a passing grade on this one. I&rsquo;ve yet to use any of these tools (chef, puppet, etc&hellip;) on a project. In my spare time I&rsquo;ve tried them out and understand the gist of how they work. I do question how necessary they are though. Unless you&rsquo;re doing massive scaling it seems like they just add extra overhead for simple scenarios.</li>
<li>Move this blog (2011) &ndash; This will be my last post on this blog engine. I&rsquo;ve currently setup Octopress and have my new blog ready on github. I just have the task of migrating over all posts (and deleting some). I have more to say about Octopress soon.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Development Goals for 2012:</h2>

<p>2012 is going to be different for me development wise. I&rsquo;m finding myself less focused on technical issues and more on system, culture, and people goals. I&rsquo;m striving to become more of a leader (clear sign of post-technical syndrome) and I think that&rsquo;s reflected in my resolutions for this year.</p>

<h3>Stop reading comments</h3>

<p>Often when I read comments online I want to get those precious minutes of my life back. I favour a discussion over pointless online kibitzing any day. Now of course every scenario is different. The probability of reading comments on Youtube or on some news website is very low. On a blog post about some technical issue, I&rsquo;ll likely read the comments.</p>

<h3>No client work when away from client</h3>

<p>Being away from the client is not a place in space problem, it&rsquo;s a frame of mind issue. I want to develop some skills in removing myself from the client mentally. This is purely for my own sanity and likely for the sanity of those around me. I&rsquo;m finding myself disconnected from my personal goals and more focused at facilitating the goals of whom I am working for. One thing I&rsquo;ve learned by being on the road is that ME time is harder to come by. As an introverted individual, that ME time is how I recharge.</p>

<h3>Complete YDeliver</h3>

<p>Hey, an actual technical resolution! By the end of 2012 I want to know that at least 5 projects are using YDeliver. It&rsquo;s incomplete right now and I need to get off my arse and complete some of the &ldquo;last mile&rdquo; stories to get it out there. I also don&rsquo;t want to be the single committer to the project. This is a call for help for anyone interested in participating! I have some very strong opinions on how some of the pieces should work together and I will be happy to provide guidance.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>

<p>Yeah, so this is probably less interesting than previous years. I&rsquo;m actually very happy on how my previous resolutions have developed and are continuing to get better and better. In previous years I mentioned developing something on a completely different stack (like Ruby on Rails). Next year I&rsquo;m starting a new project working on a small application that involves iOS and ruby development. So work is going to force some of my previous resolutions on me.</p>
