<div class="entry-content"><p>I was tempted to not write this post. My motivations are changing a bit and growing strong technically isn&rsquo;t one of
my top priorities nowadays.</p>

<h2>Reflections on <a href="/my-developer-resolutions-for-2013/">2013</a></h2>

<p>Last year was very interesting for me. It&rsquo;s the first time I didn&rsquo;t really have a home. I&rsquo;ve split my time between
India, United States, and South Africa, (ok, I was in Toronto for a few weeks too). During that time I&rsquo;ve reflected a
lot (probably too much). My work was split between training new software developers and developing tools to deploy
the largest and most complex distributed system I&rsquo;ve ever worked on.</p>

<p>First, let&rsquo;s look back at 2013 and see how I did with my resolutions:</p>

<ul>
<li>Read 7 Languages in 7 Weeks &ndash; This was a massive fail. I never even got past chapter 1!</li>
<li>More Presentations &ndash; I would give myself a passing grade here. I&rsquo;ve started doing more internal presentations, but
I&rsquo;m sure that there&rsquo;s expectation for me to do more. The problem here is that I really don&rsquo;t enjoy delivering
presentations, but I do struggle when I believe I have interesting things to say and they&rsquo;re stuck in my head. I
definitely need an outlet and will have to figure this out going forward.</li>
<li>Expand my Ops Toolbelt &ndash; This one was definitely a success. I&rsquo;ve picked up Puppet, Ansible and MCollective. Also, I
feel that I&rsquo;ve grown quite adept at Continuous Delivery pipelines and Vagrantizing development environments.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Development Goals for 2014:</h2>

<p>2014 is going to be a different year for me. I don&rsquo;t really care about goals as much, but want to build better habits. I&rsquo;ve reached
many of my goals only to regress behaviour after the goals have been achieved. I&rsquo;ve realized that many of my technical
goals were due more to my ego and fear of looking dumb in front of colleagues and clients. I&rsquo;ve realized that I actually
have a pretty good personal brand, and that people respect my abilities. I&rsquo;ve proven myself over and over again, and
it&rsquo;s time for me to believe it myself.</p>

<h3>Increase Signal to Noise Ratio</h3>

<p>Social media tax is too high for me right now. It&rsquo;s time to start culling the amount of inputs I have. At least I&rsquo;ve
deleted my LinkedIn account. I&rsquo;m going to have a daily unfriend/unfollow 1 person, until I feel things are a bit more
manageable. One small victory in 2013 was deleting my LinkedIn account.</p>

<p>Improving my e-mail habits are up there as well. Things like not checking my e-mail before work is a habit that I plan
on picking up. I also need to write less e-mails. E-mails beget more e-mail.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Facebook Friends at end of 2013</strong> == 480</li>
<li><strong>Following on Twitter at of 2013</strong> == 627</li>
</ul>


<h3>Learn Docker</h3>

<p>OK, I&rsquo;ll sneak in a technical goal. I want to simply understand what the hype is around <a href="https://www.docker.io/">Docker</a>. I tend to be very slow
to catch onto trends. There&rsquo;s enough hype around Docker that I think I should at least understand what I&rsquo;m missing if I
do miss that boat.</p>

<h3>Do Meaningful Work</h3>

<p>4 years ago I left <a href="http://www.cbc.ca/">CBC</a> for <a href="http://www.thoughtworks.com/">ThoughtWorks</a>. I don&rsquo;t regret the decision at all, but I now understand what it&rsquo;s like to do
meaningful work. Working on <a href="http://music.cbc.ca/#/blogs/2009/12/Today-on-Lanarama-Techie-Tuesday-A-Fond-Farewell-to-Scott-Muc">Radio 3</a> was fulfilling work, and I&rsquo;m still proud of what was created, and have strong
connections with the people I worked with there.</p>

<p>The tough part about the consulting business is that you can potentially work for money hungry
organisations. I personally don&rsquo;t want to help retail vendors sell more shirts, or banks earn more interest.
ThoughtWorks does do a lot of meaningful work, and I&rsquo;m going to do something I find more fulfilling. Another
stint in India doing ThoughtWorks University would be something that would satisfying this need.</p>

<p>Being a competent developer, I think I owe it to society to do what I can for a greater good. So I&rsquo;m looking at
contributing to <a href="http://www.mailpile.is/">MailPile</a> as a first step. The open government space is something I would like to explore as
well.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>

<p>I think 2013 was a bit of a downer because of what&rsquo;s been revealed by <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/interactive/2013/nov/01/snowden-nsa-files-surveillance-revelations-decoded#section/1">Edward Snowden</a>. The numerous large scale
<a href="http://thinkprogress.org/security/2013/12/31/3108661/10-biggest-privacy-security-breaches-rocked-2013/">theft of e-mail addresses and passwords</a> have also lowered confidence in IT as a whole. Let&rsquo;s not talk about <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2013/10/20/4859316/healthcare-gov-woes">Obama Care</a>.
It&rsquo;s frustating to see the industry that I love so much do so much harm, and become so untrustworthy.
2014 is going to shape to be an interesting year as a result of these events.</p>
