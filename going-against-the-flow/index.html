<div class="entry-content"><p>Developers like to talk about being in a state of
<a href="http://psygrammer.com/2011/02/10/the-flow-programming-in-ecstasy/">flow</a>. This is when time just seems to fly
by and you&rsquo;re writing more code in a few hours than you do in several days when you&rsquo;re not &ldquo;flowing&rdquo;. While I think
flowing can be postive, it often can do more harm than good if going on for <strong>too long</strong>.</p>

<p>In the past I would complain that the environment around me kept me from the <strong>flow</strong>. I would look forward to the quiet
times in the office when I could zone out for hours and complete some wild and crazy code I was working on. Many times
I would return the next day and realize that I could have done it simpler, or there were many other aspects of the
problem that I didn&rsquo;t take into consideration. One of the biggest complaints about flow is that it takes a long time to
get into that state. How can we minimize this time, and keep these flows shorter?</p>

<p><img class="right" src="/images/blog/flow.png">What I found myself needing were breaks. Brief moments to reflect on the past bit of effort and reflect on what work was
done and where it&rsquo;s heading. Many times this has resulted in an &ldquo;aha&rdquo; moment and see that my path is not going towards a
solution that is best for the project. It&rsquo;s also a good time to check your assumptions. You may be flowing towards a
dead-end because of something a little bit of planning could have prevented. Like the diagram to the right suggests,
flow can result in effort that&rsquo;s far from the solution, whereas the small bursts follow a &ldquo;truer&rdquo; path. After the flow
session is it easy to get back on track? Sometimes it&rsquo;s best to simply eliminate all you&rsquo;ve worked on and start from
scratch.</p>

<p>This leads me to <a href="http://www.jamesshore.com/Agile-Book/spike_solutions.html">spiking</a>. Getting into a flow can be useful
when performing a spike. It can reduce the spike time, but is it really possible to flow when working on something you
don&rsquo;t have any clue about?</p>

<p>When programming solo I try my best to always practice the <a href="http://www.pomodorotechnique.com/">pomodoro technique</a>.
There have been so many times that the break (and I try to be disciplined about stopping when the timer goes off, even
when I&rsquo;m in the middle of something) introduces new ways of tackling the problem.</p>

<p>When pairing I experience similar gains with breaks. I never considered this technique when pairing, because I always thought that the
practice already mitigated the risks I mentioned earlier. That may be true, but thanks to <a href="http://johnpdaigle.com/">Paul Daigle</a>, I
found that it was just as effective when pairing. It&rsquo;s even better because you have
someone to reflect upon the pairing session with. A quick time away from the code is a good time to recall what problem
you&rsquo;re actually trying to solve and whether or not the direction you&rsquo;re going is actually going to lead you there.</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re leading a technical team and you see everyone glued to their monitors and typing franctically, you might think
that they are &ldquo;flowing&rdquo; and working at a heightened level of productivity. Think again, they could possibly be racing towards
the wrong direction. A team that&rsquo;s moving around, going for walks, taking 5 to do a
<a href="http://www.tabatatimer.com/">tabata</a> to me is a sign of a more switched on team.</p>
